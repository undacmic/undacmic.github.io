## ARM Cortex-M0+ Reset Behavior

The Cortex-M0+ has the following reset behavior according to this well documented presentation [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://community.arm.com/support-forums/f/soc-design-and-simulation-forum/54006/understanding-reset-sequence-cortex-m0&ved=2ahUKEwjPjMOM3riKAxUfiv0HHXUTGkEQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0FCZVU6DNUNLWvWUzluuz3):
  - Reads the **Initial SP**, also called the **MSP (Main Stack Pointer)** 
  - Reads the **reset vector**
  - Branches to the starting of the program execution address (**reset handler**)
  - Subsequently executes program instructions (TBD in the `Reset_Handler` function)


## Reset_Handler
  A strong reference point was [this forum post](https://allthingsembedded.com/post/2019-01-03-arm-cortex-m-startup-code-for-c-and-c/) and also [this implementation](https://github.com/elzoughby/STM32H7xx-Startup/tree/master) for the **STM32H7xx** series.

  1. Define the interrupt vector table for the NVIC according to the Cortex-M0+ Manual and STM32G0x1xx series reference Manual.

  ```c
  void (* g_pfnVectors[])(void) __attribute__((section (".isr_vector"))) = {...}
  ```
  2. Move the **MSP** to the **SP (Stack Pointer**) using inline assembly and `LDR` instruction _(see page 141 from ARMv6-m Architecture Manual)_. It uses the `_estack` symbol defined in the linker script.

  ```c
  __asm (
        "LDR R0, =_estack       \n\t"
        "MOV SP, R0             \n\t"
    );
  ```
  3. Initialize the `.data` section. In order to use symbols from the ``.data`` section, the startup code needs to copy the data from ``LMA (Flash)`` to ``VMA (SRAM)`` to make sure that all C code can access the initialized data. It uses the `_data_start`, `data_end` symbols for the virtual adresses and `_sidata` symbol for the start address of the LMA of the `.data` section.

  ```c
  uint32_t *dataSrc = &_sidata, *dataDest = &_data_start;
    while (dataDest < &_data_end) {
        *dataDest++ = *dataSrc++;
    }
  ```
  4. Initialize the `.bss` section to zero using inline assembly. It uses the `_bss_start` and `_bss_end` symbols defined in the linker script.

  ```c
    __asm (
        "LDR R0, =_bss_start      \n\t"
        "LDR R1, =_bss_end        \n\t"
        "MOV R2, #0               \n\t"
        "loop_zero:               \n\t"
        "   CMP 	R0, R1          \n\t"
        "   BGE 	end_loop        \n\t"
        "   STR	R2, [R0]        \n\t"
        "   ADD   R0, R0, #4      \n\t"
        "   B 	loop_zero       \n\t"
        "end_loop:                \n\t"
    );
  ```

## Linker Script

Linking is the last step in the compilation of a program. It takes a number of object files and merges them into a single executable or binary file.

The *linker script* is a file made up of a series of linker directives that tells the linker (`arm-none-eabi-gcc` in our case) which sections to include in the output file, as well as which order to put them in, what type of file is to be produced, and what is to be the address of the first instruction.

A linker script (**.ld**) is comprised of four sections:
  - Memory layout in which we describe, not define, the attributes of a memory zone (read, write, execute), the origin address and the lenngth of the area

  ![STM32G0B1RE Memory Organization](images/memory_organization.png)

  ```LD
MEMORY {
    FLASH (rx)      : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 512K   
    SRAM  (xrw)     : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 144K
}
  ```
  - Section definitions which describe how the sections form the input object files will be mapped to sections inside the output file
  ```LD
SECTIONS {
    .isr_vector : {
        KEEP(*(.isr_vector))
    } >FLASH

    .text : {
        . = ALIGN(4);
        *(.text)
        *(.text*)
        . = ALIGN(4);
        _etext = .;
    } >FLASH

    ...
}
  ```
  - Options: commands to specify architecture, entry point, â€¦etc. if needed
  ```LD
  ENTRY(Reset_Handler)

  OUTPUT_FORMAT ("elf32-littlearm")
  ```
  - Symbols: variables to inject into the program at link time
  ```LD
  _estack = ORIGIN(SRAM) + LENGTH(SRAM);
  ```

The entire *linker script* can be found on my **Github repository**.

| `SECTIONS`  | Defines the mapping between the sections of the input object files to the sections of the linker's output file, by specifying the memory layout of each output section.                |
| `KEEP`      | Tells the linker to not remove the section wrapped by this command. Important when working with ARM microprocessors because the interrupt vector table must be in a predefined memory location and is not referenced directly by code. |

| `VMA`       | Virtual Memory Address.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `.`         | Location Counter.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `ALIGN`     | Introduces the required amount of padding to align the location counter.                                                                                                              |

## Clock Configuration

The purpose of the *System_Init* function is to configure the *PLL Block* of the *Clock tree* with a frequency of **64 MHz** and to select *PLLRCLK* as the *SYSCLK* source.

The configuration of the board clocks is interfaced by *RCC* (Reset and Clock Control). This module provides several registries necessary for the *PLL* configuration.

But first, in order to simplify this process, we can reproduce the structure of the module using a struct, each registry being a struct variable with the type of `uint32_t`.

Using a pointer to the aforementioned struct, I will map a specific address of the board's memory. When I say specific, I refer to the fact that we want that each of our struct alterations to impact the corresponding hardware characteristic as well.

> [!TIP] **RCC memory address**
> We can check the board's memory organization inside the  **STM32G0x1xx Reference Manual, page 64, Table 6** and find that **RRC** starts at address **0x4002 1000**

![STM32G0x1 Peripheral Register Boundary](images/rrc_address.drawio.png)

```c
typedef struct {
    volatile uint32_t CR;
    volatile uint32_t ICSCR;
    volatile uint32_t CFGR;
    volatile uint32_t PLLCFGR;
    volatile uint32_t RESERVED;
    volatile uint32_t CRRCR;
    volatile uint32_t CIER;
    volatile uint32_t CIFR;
    volatile uint32_t CICR;
    volatile uint32_t IOPRSTR;
    volatile uint32_t AHBRSTR;
    volatile uint32_t APBRSTR1;
    volatile uint32_t APBRSTR2;
    volatile uint32_t IOPENR;
    volatile uint32_t AHBENR;
    volatile uint32_t APBENR1;
    volatile uint32_t APBENR2;
    volatile uint32_t IOPSMENR;
    volatile uint32_t AHBSMENR;
    volatile uint32_t APBSMENR1;
    volatile uint32_t APBSMENR2;
    volatile uint32_t CCIPR;
    volatile uint32_t CCIPR2;
    volatile uint32_t BDCR;
    volatile uint32_t CSR;
} RCC_Def;

#define RCC_BASE                    0x40021000
#define RCC                         ((RCC_Def*) RCC_BASE)
```

This way, we can use the `RCC` macro to update the hardware peripheral to our desired state.

Taking a look at the clock tree, we can see which parts are of interest when deriving the *PLLRCLK*.

![PLL Block](images/rcc_clock_tree.drawio.png)

 - f<sub>PLLIN</sub> the input frequency which can be either the 16 MHz HSI or the frequency provided by the HSE (which requires an external oscillator)
 - **M** and **N** parameters by the help of which we derive the f<sub>VCO</sub> frequency
 - Finally, the **R** parameter for deriving the frequency of the *PLLRCLK*.

The formula by which the output f<sub>PLLR</sub> is calculated is the following:
<pre style="padding: 15px;"> 
f<sub>PLLR</sub> = ((f<sub>PLLIN</sub> / M) * N) / R,
where:
  - f<sub>PLLIN</sub> is the frequency of HSI16 clock source of 16 MHz
  - M, N and R are configurable parameters using PLLCFGR register
</pre>

To start configuring, we need to make sure that the PLL clock is turned off.
```c
RCC->CR &= ~RCC_CR_PLLON_MASK;
while (RCC->CR & RCC_CR_PLLRDY_MASK) {
}
```

We need to explicitly select the input clock source as the HSI16.
```c
RCC->PLLCFGR &= ~RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLSRC_MASK;
RCC->PLLCFGR |= RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLSRC(2);
```

Generating the VCO frequency requires a specific range of values which need be obtained by the use of **M** and **N**.
As stated in the reference manual, after the division with *M* the input clock frequency needs to be between 2.66 and 16 MHz and after the multiplication with *N* it needs to be between 96 and 344 MHz.

I will use **M = 2** and **N = 16** to obtain f<sub>VCO</sub> = **128 MHz**.

```c
RCC->PLLCFGR &= ~RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLM_MASK;
RCC->PLLCFGR |= RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLM(1);

RCC->PLLCFGR &= ~RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLN_MASK;
RCC->PLLCFGR |= RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLN(16);
```

Finally, I will also set **R = 2** to obtain a final PLLR frequency of **64 MHz**.

```c
RCC->PLLCFGR &= ~RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLR_MASK;
RCC->PLLCFGR |= RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLR(1);
```
We can now turn on the PLL as we have finished the configuration, and also enable PLLR. After the clock has successfully turned on, I will select it as the **SYSCLK**.

```c
RCC->CR |= RCC_CR_PLLON_MASK;

RCC->PLLCFGR |= RCC_PLLCFGR_PLLREN_MASK;

while (! (RCC->CR & RCC_CR_PLLRDY_MASK)) {
}

RCC->CFGR |= RCC_CFGR_SW(2);
```

> [!CAUTION] **Flash Latency**
> To correctly read data from flash memory, the number of wait states (LATENCY) must be
correctly programmed in the FLASH access control register (FLASH_ACR) according to the
frequency of the flash memory clock (HCLK)

For a HCLK with a frequency of 64MHz or more, 2 wait states are required and this modification needs to be made before setting **PLLRCLK** as the **SYSCLK**.

```c
FLASH->ACR |= FLASH_ACR_LATENCY(2);
FLASH->ACR |= FLASH_ACR_PRFTEN_MASK;
while ((FLASH->ACR & FLASH_ACR_LATENCY_MASK) != 2) {
}
```
