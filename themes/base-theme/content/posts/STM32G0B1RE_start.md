> The problem: \
>     The necessity to write my own startup code for a microcontroller I was working on, specifically STM32G0B1R

> Why? 
>    1. I don't like to work with IDE's and I want my workflow to be as straightforward as possible. 
>    2. I also don't want to make a wrapper over the CMSIS headers as my intention is to use only the neccesary peripherics

> How? \
>     In what follows I will describe the steps needed to reproduce my setup and also the documentation required for understanding the concepts.

## Startup Script

### ARM Cortex-M0+ Reset Behavior

The Cortex-M0+ has the following reset behavior according to this well documented presentation [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://community.arm.com/support-forums/f/soc-design-and-simulation-forum/54006/understanding-reset-sequence-cortex-m0&ved=2ahUKEwjPjMOM3riKAxUfiv0HHXUTGkEQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0FCZVU6DNUNLWvWUzluuz3):
  - Reads the **Initial SP**, also called the **MSP (Main Stack Pointer)** 
  - Reads the **reset vector**
  - Branches to the starting of the program execution address (**reset handler**)
  - Subsequently executes program instructions (TBD in the `Reset_Handler` function)

### 

### `Reset_Handler`
  A strong reference point was [this forum post](https://allthingsembedded.com/post/2019-01-03-arm-cortex-m-startup-code-for-c-and-c/) and also [this implementation](https://github.com/elzoughby/STM32H7xx-Startup/tree/master) for the **STM32H7xx** series.

  1. Define the interrupt vector table for the NVIC according to the Cortex-M0+ Manual and STM32G0x1xx series reference Manual.

  ```c
  void (* g_pfnVectors[])(void) __attribute__((section (".isr_vector"))) = {...}
  ```
  2. Move the **MSP** to the **SP (Stack Pointer**) using inline assembly and `LDR` instruction _(see page 141 from ARMv6-m Architecture Manual)_. It uses the `_estack` symbol defined in the linker script.

  ```c
  __asm (
        "LDR R0, =_estack       \n\t"
        "MOV SP, R0             \n\t"
    );
  ```
  3. Initialize the `.data` section. In order to use symbols from the ``.data`` section, the startup code needs to copy the data from ``LMA (Flash)`` to ``VMA (SRAM)`` to make sure that all C code can access the initialized data. It uses the `_data_start`, `data_end` symbols for the virtual adresses and `_sidata` symbol for the start address of the LMA of the `.data` section.

  ```c
  uint32_t *dataSrc = &_sidata, *dataDest = &_data_start;
    while (dataDest < &_data_end) {
        *dataDest++ = *dataSrc++;
    }
  ```
  4. Initialize the `.bss` section to zero using inline assembly. It uses the `_bss_start` and `_bss_end` symbols defined in the linker script.

  ```c
    __asm (
        "LDR R0, =_bss_start      \n\t"
        "LDR R1, =_bss_end        \n\t"
        "MOV R2, #0               \n\t"
        "loop_zero:               \n\t"
        "   CMP 	R0, R1          \n\t"
        "   BGE 	end_loop        \n\t"
        "   STR	R2, [R0]        \n\t"
        "   ADD   R0, R0, #4      \n\t"
        "   B 	loop_zero       \n\t"
        "end_loop:                \n\t"
    );
  ```
### `System_Init`
The purpose of this function is to configure the `PLL Block` of the `Clock tree` with a frequency of **64 MHz** and to select `PLLRCLK` as the `SYSCLK` source.

The formula by which the output f<sub>PLLR</sub> is calculated is the following:
<pre>
f<sub>PLLR</sub> = ((f<sub>PLLIN</sub> / M) * N) / R,
where:
  - f<sub>PLLIN</sub> is the frequency of HSI16 clock source of 16 MHz
  - M, N and R are configurable parameters using PLLCFGR register
</pre>

## Linker Script



| **KEYWORD** | **DESCRIPTION**                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SECTIONS`  | Defines the mapping between the sections of the input object files to the sections of the linker's output file, by specifying the memory layout of each output section.                |
| `KEEP`      | Tells the linker to not remove the section wrapped by this command. Important when working with ARM microprocessors because the interrupt vector table must be in a predefined memory location and is not referenced directly by code. |
| `LMA`       | Load Memory Address.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `VMA`       | Virtual Memory Address.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `.`         | Location Counter.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `ALIGN`     | Introduces the required amount of padding to align the location counter.                                                                                                              |


## Usage

To be able to run the rules inside the provided `Makefile` you are required to also install the [ARM GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads):

```
  sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

1. Create `.hex` file using the Makefile rule:
```
make all
```
2. Flash the device
```
st-flash --format ihex write program.hex

2024-12-22T16:36:26 INFO common.c: STM32G0Bx_G0Cx: 144 KiB SRAM, 512 KiB flash in at least 2 KiB pages.
2024-12-22T16:36:26 WARN common_flash.c: Flash base use default L0 address

(OPTIONAL) 3. Start a `gdb` connection using `st-util` and connect locally using `gdb-multiarch`

```
sudo apt-get install gdb-multiarch

# Inside the first terminal window
st-util

# Inside the second terminal window
gdb-multiarch

(gdb) file program.hex
(gdb) target remote localhost:4242
(gdb) ...
